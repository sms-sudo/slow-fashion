			<h1>Nike </h1>
			<p> It would be an understatement to not acknowledge one of the largest, if not the largest, household-name sportswear company that goes by Nike. Despite being one of the more environmentally friendly companies in terms of material sourcing, production emissions and product recycling, Nike is plagued with unethical practices. In fact in 2017, Nike has barred the Worker Rights Consortium from being able to independently monitor Nikeâ€™s supplier factories. Not only was this a commitment to a respected civil society humans right group, but also a step backwards in transparency for all of its production. </p>
