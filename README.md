## General info
A website created for a hackathon to raise awarness of the negagitive effects of fast fashion. Included is a sustainable fashion tinder game made using unity (on Home page) that allows you to swipe rigtht or left on brands that you believe are fast fashion, and local alternatives for sustainable brands. On the Sustainable Fashion page we offer curated tips and tutorials on reusing and redesigning, thrifting and sustainable brand alternatives. On the Fast Fashion Stocks page we have interactive plots of the stock volume of five large unsustainable companies as well as a petition against the exploitive nature of such companies. On the Sustainable Brands page we curated 15 different local up-coming sustainable fashion brands ranging from small family businesses to larger organizations, and their contact information. On the Fast Fashion Brands page we curated more brands and information on their specific practices in exploitations and why they are fast fashion.
