			<h1>Forever 21 </h1>
			<p> Forever 21, the California retailer that helped popularize fast fashion in the United States with its bustling stores and $5 tops, said on Sunday night that it would file for bankruptcy, a sign of the eroding power of shopping malls and the shifting tastes of young consumers. Forever 21 said that it would continue to operate its website and hundreds of stores in the United States, where it is a major tenant for mall owners, as well as stores in Mexico and Latin America. However, the company has yet to address the failure to pay its workers a livable wage in both overseas production factories and ones located in California itself. </p>
