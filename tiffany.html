			<h1>Tiffany & Co. </h1>
			<p> Tiffany & Co. is one of the more sustainable brands on this list, however in 2017 it sold more than $500 million worth of diamond engagement rings. It recognizes the issues with the lack of transparency of which country the diamond was mined, and where it was cut, polished and set as it provides many holes to allow for exploitation of child labourers and underpaid workers. Again, Tiffany & Co. has made promises that after collaborating with IBM to trace the provenance of diamond and gold engagement rings it will eliminate all unethical production, but only time will tell. </p>
