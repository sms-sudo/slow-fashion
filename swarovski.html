			<h1>Swarovski </h1>
			<p> Swarovski, an Austrian based producer of glass, has privately existed as a family-owned business since 1895. There is no evidence that Swarovski partakes in production that is costly to the environment, but it does show signs of unethical development and sales. While this includes locking access to its history in between the years of 1931 and 1949 (dubbed the “Nazi period”), Swarovski also makes profits off of minority groups without taking steps to put down any meaningful and lasting contributions such as the “Tribute to Tribe” which was with collaboration with Brazilian indigenous peoples. This was just another company choosing a “popularized” image of a marginalized culture to make a profit. </p>
